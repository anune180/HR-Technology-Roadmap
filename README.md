# HR-Technology-Roadmap
Worked closely with project management to identify their needs. Prepared data in Excel, imported it into Power BI, and developed a sustainable, automated HR Technology Roadmap using filters and high-level design tools. This roadmap replaced the previous manual model, showing COEs, projects under each COE, and the quarterly deadline periods for each task. It enables efficient organization, tracking, and planning, significantly saving the company time and effort.
